I have created a simple tic-tac-toe game in C language. This is the first version of the code and I plan to create more interesting games in the future. In this game, two players take turns marking X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
